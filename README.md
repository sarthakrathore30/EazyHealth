# HealthCare AI - Intelligent Disease Prediction System

A machine learning-powered health assistant that provides disease predictions based on symptoms, BMI calculations, and health information.

## 🚨 IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This application is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.**

- This tool does NOT provide medical diagnosis or treatment advice
- Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical concerns
- In case of emergency, call your local emergency number immediately
- AI predictions have limitations and may be inaccurate

## Features

### 🧠 ML-Powered Disease Prediction
- **Real Machine Learning**: Uses scikit-learn with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting ensemble
- **70+ Diseases**: Comprehensive database with genuine medical data covering 15+ categories
- **Symptom Vectorization**: TF-IDF-like encoding with synonym resolution
- **Risk-Adjusted Predictions**: Accounts for age, symptom duration, and severity
- **Categories Include**: Respiratory, Cardiovascular, Gastrointestinal, Neurological, Endocrine, Mental Health, Musculoskeletal, Skin, Renal, Eye, Infectious, Environmental, Sleep disorders

### 🚨 Emergency Detection
- **Critical Symptom Combinations**: Detects life-threatening conditions
- **Multi-factor Assessment**: Considers symptom combinations, duration, and age
- **Immediate Alerts**: Clear warnings with emergency contact information

### ⚖️ BMI Calculator
- BMI calculation with category classification
- Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) calculation
- Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
- Personalized health advice

### 💬 Health Chatbot
- NLP-powered responses on health topics
- Emergency keyword detection
- Disease information lookup

### 🔒 Security Features
- Input sanitization (XSS prevention)
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- Secure data handling

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd EazyHealth
```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **(Optional) Install scikit-learn for enhanced ML**

If you have Visual C++ Build Tools installed:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

Without scikit-learn, the app will use a pure Python prediction engine that still works well.

5. **Run the application**
```bash
python app.py
```

6. **Open in browser**
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Troubleshooting

**Python 3.13+ users:** Some packages may not have pre-built wheels yet. The application will work without scikit-learn using the pure Python fallback predictor.

**Windows users without Visual C++ Build Tools:** 
- The app works without scikit-learn
- Or install Build Tools from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

## ML Model Details

### Architecture
- **Primary Model**: Random Forest Classifier (100 estimators)
- **Secondary Model**: Gradient Boosting Classifier (50 estimators)
- **Ensemble**: Weighted average (70% RF, 30% GB)

### Training
- Auto-trains on first run using disease-symptom data
- Generates augmented samples with symptom variations
- Cross-validation for accuracy measurement
- Model persisted to disk for future use

### Features
- Symptom vectorization with weight support
- Synonym resolution for natural input
- Duration and age-based risk adjustment
- Confidence scoring with symptom matching

## Known Limitations

1. **Not a Medical Device**: This is an educational tool, not a certified medical device
2. **Disease Database**: 70+ diseases currently supported
3. **English Only**: Currently only supports English input
4. **No User Accounts**: No persistent user data storage
5. **Simplified NLP**: Chatbot uses keyword matching, not advanced NLP

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add more diseases to database
- [ ] Implement deep learning models
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Integrate with medical APIs
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Mobile app version
